> In layman's term, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is giving the abilities to a machine for performing a task that reduces human effort.

This can be achieved using either predetermined rules and algorithms, or pattern recognizing machine learning models. E.g. Line-following robot uses **PATTERNS** to recognize PATH (black color) and Turns the motor (**RULES**).

##### other examples are Google auto-complete

### What is Machine Learning?
.
![](https://i.imgflip.com/yjljs.jpg)

> Specialized field in Artificial Intelligence that doesn't require explicit instructions for every tasks. It learns from the experience.

## What is Supervised Learning?
##### A software system that takes human knowledge as basis for learning. e.g. 
![](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-29-at-12.05.53-PM-1-e1553890519162-958x625.png)

## How it works?
##### You pass the data in pair of (input image, label) and the System tries to learn patterns/relationships between them.
##### Next time when an Input image is given to the System, it tries to search for similar patterns and predicts the class of the Input (Probability or Confidence). E.g. the given image looks like 90% Cat & 30% Dog

### Role of Data
>Data is the Fuel that Drives Machine Learning

### How much data is enough?

#### Okay, then

## What is UnSupervised Learning?
![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-82a2512d1942859d81dcaf5db6c5be48)

## Model - What it looks like?
> Machine Learning Models are representation of **Mathematical Equations** that have learned patterns by learning from Data.

### OR
> **y = f(x)**
> .
> A model in a very simplified form is nothing but a function  that is used to take in certain input, perform certain operation to its best on the given input (learning and then predicting/classifying) and produce the suitable output.
## ML for Kids (Demo)
#### Train a simple ML model (like a chat bot) in your Browser:

# "ASSIGNMENT-A"
- Visit the ML for Kids Website: https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/
- Follow the Tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFu5vks7xPc
- Start the Project without Registering: 
![Alt Text](https://d1e2bohyu2u2w9.cloudfront.net/education/sites/default/files/experience-media-file/machine_learning_for_kids_3phases.png?)
- ##### **Problem Statement:** Chatbot
    Define a **"Text-Based"** Problem Statement, e.g. *PSNGuide, HomeAutomation, General Purpose VirtualAssistance* etc.
- Train: Select the "target labels". e.g 'fan_on', 'light_off' etc. and feed the example commands to train your model
- Test your model by asking it relevant question and observing the accuracy and "predicted label"
- Use "MAKE" tool to build your own Scratch Program that works as chatbot for the Problem statement you chose.

## What is Deep Learning
#### Biology vs technology
Just like a biological neuron has **dendrites** to receive signals, a **cell body** to process them, and an **axon** to send signals out to other neurons, the Artificial neuron has a number of **input channels**, a processing stage, and one output that can fan out to multiple other artificial neurons.

## Neural Networks
![](https://mk0analyticsindf35n9.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nural-network-banner.gif)

## Real-world Applications
- identify faces,
- recognize speech,
- read your handwriting (mine perhaps not),
- translate texts,
- play games (typically board games or card games)
- control autonomous vehicles and robots
- and surely a couple more things!

## Computer Vision - Specialization in AI

## Human Eyes (Optic Nerves)

The **Occipital lobe**: The back part of the brain that is involved with **Vision**.
**Temporal lobe**: The sides of the brain, are involved in short-term memory, speech, musical rhythm, and some degree of smell recognition.

# "ASSIGNMENT-B" - Transfer Learning using YOLOv3
- Follow the Instructions in this GitRepo: https://github.com/theschoolofai/YoloV3
- Take reference from the Colab Notebook: https://github.com/upadhyayprakash/ai-chapter/blob/master/YOLOv3.
- Choose a Class that's **NOT** there in the COCO Dataset(80 classes). Collect 200 Images of the class - Scrap from Web or Download
- COCO Dataset Reference: http://cocodataset.org/#explore
- Annotate the Custom Images using YOLOv3 Annotation Tool:
    Link: https://github.com/miki998/YoloV3_Annotation_Tool
- Train a YOLOv3 with the Custom Annotated dataset using the Transfer Learning
- Upload the output video to LinkedIn / YouTube - Believe me, you'd love People's reaction!
